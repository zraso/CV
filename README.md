I'm a full-stack software developer about to graduate from Makers Academy, who combines this strong technical knowledge with years of community engagement and programme management experience.

# Background

In the 7 years I spent in community engagement and setting up and running a social enterprise, I realised my affinity to technology and the energy I got from solving problems. So I signed up to an intensive dev bootcamp and never looked back.

I'm trained in agile development at Makers, as well as pair programming, test-driven development (TDD) and object-oriented programming (OOP). I am highly empathetic, have a very intuitive understanding of user needs, and a strong knowledge of psychology backed by years of diverse community engagement experience.

I want to bring my unique skill set, drive and commitment to a workplace with coding best practices, strong team dynamics, room to grow, and where the work I do has a clear purpose.

# Skills and qualities

#### Excellent communication
One of my proudest moments was to design and deliver a 5-day training session on Business and Enterprise for microbusiness owners in Gambia, West Africa. I was able to instill confidence in the participants, explain complex ideas simply, and tailor information to be appropriate to the context. [Here’s a video about the course](https://youtu.be/k-88lQF222U).

#### Attention to detail
My experience in volunteer and youth programme management have included coordinating multiple groups of people in large numbers including a team of 40 volunteers for the Big Noise Festival. My responsibilities included recruitment, organising activities, rotas, managing onboarding, pastoral care, health and safety, rapport building, and staff team management. 

#### Adaptability
I’ve grown up in 4 different countries (India, Pakistan, Australia and UK), attended 8 different schools and worked in roles that required me to quickly change based on the clients I was working with. In my role facilitating workshops and programmes for young people at IntoUniversity, I was required to fill the gap in short-staffed teams last minute, and quickly familiarise myself with programme content, as well as build immediate rapport with clients and beneficiaries.

#### High energy
I'm recognised for my energetic and highly proactive personality. One of my strongest qualities is my willingness to speak up and fully engage with the task at hand. This is why I really flourish in teams. For example, on the Acebook project at Makers Academy, I particularly effective at being a driving force in the team, ensuring that I volunteered support to the scrum leader if they had to juggle too many responsibilities, or used my initiative to solve issues to avoid blockages in the workflow.

#### Resilience
I am a highly resilient person, particularly demonstrated in my experiences in the youth and community sector. On one occasion, I led a residential programme of 72 young people, most from deprived communities in South London. In just one day, I needed to coordinate their arrival to their accomodation, lead a full day of activities from 8am to 9pm, support a young girl out of a panic attack, keep all the 72 young people calm when a stranger approched the group to verbally abuse them, and take two seperate young people to A&E due to injuries, and still make sure everyone was in bed in time.
